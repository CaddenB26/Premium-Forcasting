# Premium-Forcasting


## Executive Summary:

    
A car insurance company is needing their data that they have been collecting exported to excel, cleaned, variable adjusted from decimals to whole numbers and from the metric system to imperial system. After that was complete the data was turned into 2 separate pivot tables linking the age of the vehichle and the safety rating of the vehicle, and the average age of the client and how old the car was. After that was completed the data was exported once again to python so a random forest classification test could be performed on how old a car was and its safety rating.

### Business Problem: 

  A car insurance company is trying to figure out the risk of a clients premium being used due to the age of the vehicle and the overall safety of the vehicle to assess if premiums should go up due to factors such as the risk of vehicle age and the safety rating of the car.


### Methodology: 

1. Excel- data cleaning(remove duplicates, trim whitespace), conversions from metric to imperial system, pivot table
2. Python- created a randomforestclassification ML model
### Skills:

Excel- data cleaning, pivot tables
Python- randomforestclassification, intermidiate coding, ML model




### Results & Business Recommendation: 

  The accuracy of the randomforestclassification model was 0.50 or 50% telling us that the risk did not differ from a newer car to an older car allowing the car insurance company to leave their premiums alone due to the age of the car.
